  <h2 class="section-title">Requirements Gathering</h2>
  <p>I collaborated with the project managers, client, and developers to discuss the business requirements, target users, and brainstorm the design/functionality. The initial website issues involved a problematic navigation and non-responsive user interface. I also inspected the website's Google Analytics to give me an overview of their website visitors' demographics and website behaviors.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Design</h2>
  <p>We focused on creating more aesthetically unique pages, consistent navigation, and a responsive user interface. I created wireframes and mockups to visualize the design and gain feedback from the client and digital team.</p>

  <p>After a couple of design iterations and approval from the client, the development was assigned to an external agency to build the website using a content management system (CMS).</p>
