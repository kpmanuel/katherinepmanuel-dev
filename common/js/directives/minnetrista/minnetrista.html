  <h2 class="section-title">Requirements Gathering</h2>
  <p>I met with the project managers and client to discuss the business requirements and brainstorm the design/features. The current issues involved a problematic navigation and non-responsive user interface. I also inspected the analytics to give me an overview of their website visitors and website behaviors.</p>
