  <h2 class="section-title">Design &amp; Development</h2>
  <p>I created mockups to visualize the design and gain feedback from the digital team. After a couple of design iterations and approval from the team, I worked with the developer to build the microsite using HTML5, CSS3, and AngularJS. We finished the fully functional site in about 6 days. This includes re-skinning/re-writing the content for a sister newspaper to provide the same promotion for their market.</p>
